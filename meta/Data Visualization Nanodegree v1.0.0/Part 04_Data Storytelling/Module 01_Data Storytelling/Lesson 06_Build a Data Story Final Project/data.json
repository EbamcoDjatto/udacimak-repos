You can choose to also convert your Microsoft PowerPoint to a Google slide deck and include the link in your submission. \n\nYour project must meet specifications in each category within the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2583/view) in order for your submission to pass.\n\nIt can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases, it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. In the meantime, you should feel free to proceed with your learning journey by continuing on to the next module in the program.\n\n",

They would like for you to walk through your recommendations and risks to the analysis that might affect your proposed action items. Your job is to provide their team with the final presentation, including an executive summary of key next steps. \n\nYour role will be to develop a final presentation that is roughly ~10-15 slides and analyses that dig into potential limitations and biases of the dataset you’re working with. \n\n## Overview\nYou will now bring together all you have learned about data storytelling by combining the ghost deck and their analyses to provide a final recommendation. You will also need to identify the limitations and biases in data that affect the recommendations you provide.\n\nYou will continue to use the same Movies Metadata CSV and conduct the EDA necessary to understand the dataset as a whole. The expected output will be to surface if the dataset is balanced, if there are anomalies in the dataset that affect the applicability of the recommendation, and the final presentation itself that will be used for a mock recommendation to a management team.\n\nDatasets:\nFor this project, you’ll be working with a choice of datasets. The description above relies on the Metadata_Movies.csv. \n\n",
