They have been collecting data on the merits of thousands of movies that have come out in the past several years and the respective audience responses. The studio is unsure what to do with the data they have and have asked you to come on board to provide insights on what they can takeaway from this data set. Your job is to provide their team with insights to a problem that matters. \n\nYour role is to define the problem that is compelling enough for the executive team to warrant taking action. From there, your role is to develop the story line of what you can expect the data to tell you from your analysis. \n\n## Project Overview\nIn this project, you will apply the skills you have learned in structuring a data story. You will be provided with a Movies Metadata CSV and will have the ability to define your own problem statement, the analyses you would conduct to solve the objective, and outline a set of potential solutions/actionable next steps for the target audience.

(FYI: The ghost deck should be a comprehensive analysis; you are encouraged to include an issue tree up front or in the appendix to help the audience understand how you structured the problem)\n3. __Include an executive summary__ that takes the team through the problem to be solved, the key takeaways, and your recommendation\n4. __ Call out hypothesized biases and limitations__ in the dataset and why they matter to a potential recommendation ",
