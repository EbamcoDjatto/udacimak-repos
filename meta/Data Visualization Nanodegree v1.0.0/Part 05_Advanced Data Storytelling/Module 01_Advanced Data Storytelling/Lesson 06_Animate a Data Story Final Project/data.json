You have successfully created an interactive data story in your first project, and now your manager has asked you to take it to another level for a presentation in the auditorium.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nYour goal of this next phase of the project is to create an animated bubble chart, make a story out of it, and add audio to narrate the story. You will be using the same dataset from the mid-term project __energy_environment_economy.csv__ to build out your narrated story in Flourish. \n",
