You are conducting research for the World Bank on historical global trends to better understand the current situation and how things have developed in different countries and regions around the world.\n\nYour manager has tasked you with conducting data analysis on a world indicators data set to find and tell a data story at a conference for global development nonprofits. You are given access to historical data going back to 1990 on a variety of country-level attributes related to energy usage, the impact on the environment, and the economy.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nIn this project, you'll build on your previously developed skills of creating charts, graphs, maps and dashboards in Tableau, and apply what you've learned in the lessons on creating stories. You will use the Tableau Story Points feature and the seven data story types in order to find, create and tell a coherent data story to your audience.\n\n\n",
