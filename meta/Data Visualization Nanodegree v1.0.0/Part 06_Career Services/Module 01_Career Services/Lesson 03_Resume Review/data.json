The job posting she has found is asking for someone to take on responsibilities including developing client-side web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and using Responsive Web Design technique to turn a designer’s mockup into the semantic HTML and CSS that browsers render. The candidate would need to do this while collaborating with a larger team of developers.\n\nAsk yourself about the example: **How is Jenny's Experience section targeted to the job she is applying for?**",

She's already worked on tasks such as implementing responsive design in her previous position.\n* Jenny has mastered the phrasing for framing her work experiences. This includes starting each bullet with an **action verb** such as \"implemented\" or \"achieved\" and avoiding the use of pronouns such as \"I.\" \n* She has described her most (relevant) **successes** at her previous positions, and provided numbers quantifying her achievements where possible. \n * Her second bullet for the cram school teacher position does not have a number to quantify her success, and that's okay. It's still a relevant achievement to mention because it showcases her initiative to make improvements and provide a solution, which is an important quality to have as a Front-End Developer.\n\nA well-written Experience section such as Jenny's, which weaves key information concisely into each bullet point, can provide compelling evidence that she is qualified for her desired role. \n\nBe sure to do the same for your own resume!",
