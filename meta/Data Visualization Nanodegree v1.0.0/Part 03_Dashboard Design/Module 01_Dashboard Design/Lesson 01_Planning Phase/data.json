              "text": "## Welcome to the Course\n\nWelcome to this course on Dashboard Design, taught by our expert instructor, Robert Crocker. In this course, you will be learning about dashboard design. The principles of dashboard design can be applied to practically any dashboard you ever create, whether it is in Excel, Tableau or any other platform.\n\n## Course Outline\n### Lesson 1: Planning Phase\nIn this lesson, Robert will be walking us through the various goals and tasks of the design phase. By the end of this lesson, you will have learned and practiced asking your audience important questions about what are their needs and expectations from the dashboard. You will know how to understand the pain points of the business stakeholder as well as the priorities the dashboard should be addressing. This foundation sets up the dashboard design process very nicely.\n\n### Lesson 2: Design Phase\nIn this lesson, Robert introduces us the to concept of graphicacy. You will learn about how to make chart choices, keep visual hierarchy in mind. You will get busy with creating doodles or early designs, followed by designing a wireframe for your dashboard, and finally building a prototype for the dashboard. You will learn about common layouts, alignment guidelines. This interim step for creating dashboard prototype is important best practice for when you are developing a dashboard. for a client or organization.\n\n### Lesson 3: Polishing Dashboard for Production\nFinally, in lesson 3, Robert will walk us through the final polishing process for the dashboard. This will include discussion and actual hands-on practice with color schemes, encoding, paying attention to interactivity and annotations. Robert will also introduce us to important concepts and best practices that are key to creating visually compelling dashboards.\n\nWe are SO excited about the dashboard you will be building as part of this course!

Most people in strategic positions won’t have the time or need to get into the nitty gritty details of the data.\n\n__Tactical audiences__ need their data to be fresh and flowing. This means the data they need in order to make their decisions are current, which also means there should be a clear indication on the dashboards about the last time the data was refreshed and potentially how long before the next refresh happens. Tactical audiences make decisions quickly and the decimal point could very well matter.",

It is not strategic because this isn’t a decision she’s weighing heavily against several other factors over a large window of time.\n\n### Persona 2\nThe answer is **Strategic** because no decisions are going to be made. It’s more for talking points than anything else. On the other hand, if the dashboard was informing what ads were going to be displayed or which stories would be written the day after, then it would be tactical.\n\n### Persona 3\nThe answer is **Strategic** because no one is being asked to immediately take action on this information. On the other hand, if guests were asked to use the information to vote on policy, donate as certain amount of money or take any other sort of action before walking away, then we might be looking at a tactical dashboard.\n",

If the stakeholders are only providing you with high-level descriptions like “we want to improve” or “get better” or “capture new market share” you need to drive them to measurable specifics that quantify what “better” means for their business or how you might be able to quantify their “current market share vs. their futures share” so you can compare one to another in a way the audience can act on.\n\nSo employ user research methods to drive them to define __what measureable specifics__ means for them? \n\nHere are some additional online resources that you can look into that describe user research methods that can be effective:\n<ol>\n<li> [Individual interviews from Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/individual-interviews.html)\n<li> [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-interviews) can be a good resource too\n\n\n#### Again, to start you off, these are some questions to consider asking the stakeholder:\n#### Data \n* How old can the data be and still be useful?\n* What’s the relevant timeline of the data?\n* Is there sensitive information we need to prevent certain people from seeing?<br>\n\n#### Form \n* What devices will the dashboard be viewed on most frequently?\n* Do you have style guides we can use?\n* Can you provide examples of dashboards or the style you would like this dashboard to imitate?",
