Now the full executive team wants a more strategic view of the business.\n\nYou need to create a dashboard that allows the team to see:\n* Top-level revenue, profit, average profit ratio and units sold\n* YoY performance by segment (segment refers to Corporate, Consumer, Home Office)\n* Monthly trend of the current year by segment (segment refers to Corporate, Consumer, Home Office)\n* View category performance\n* Best performing sub-category within each customer segment\n\nThe difference between this dashboard and the previous, besides the content, is the emphasis on performance. Your executive audience does not have the time to make all the comparisons themselves. They need you to emphasize the main points of interest they will relay to their team leads for further investigation and discuss among themselves regarding strategy.\n\n### Project Overview\nIn this project, you will incorporate the new skills you have learned around dashboard designed to grab your audienceâ€™s attention. We will be emphasizing key elements of the dashboard that continue acknowledging the audience's level of graphicacy, conscious management of color to avoid confusion, and our innate ability to identify patterns so those who find your dashboard are drawn to the key points.\n",
