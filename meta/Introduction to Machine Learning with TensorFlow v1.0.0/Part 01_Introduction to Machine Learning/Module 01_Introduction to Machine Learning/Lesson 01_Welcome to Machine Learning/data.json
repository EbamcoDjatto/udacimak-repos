There's no penalty for submitting late projects, and you can submit a project multiple times to pass. We strongly suggest that you try to submit a final solution by the listed deadline. This allows you to benefit from progressing with your classmates; also, we see that students who submit the first two projects on time have a much higher chance of completing the program as a whole!\n* **If a student has not passed all three projects by the end of program deadline, they may have to re-enroll with the next class of students for the full program price.**\n\n---\n\n\n",

We'll go over the main metrics used for evaluating models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Then, we'll learn about common **supervised learning algorithms**, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, naive Bayes, neural networks, and support vector machines. We'll also learn to combine these algorithms to achieve their full potential, in the ensemble methods section. Every section is equipped with a lab, where you'll get to apply your knowledge using sklearn.\n\n### Deep  Learning\n\nIn this section, we'll be learning the foundational math and theory behind **neural networks** that can learn to find patterns in some given data. You'll implement backpropagation and optimization using NumPy to get an understanding of neural networks, then build up to training neural networks using the deep learning framework, TensorFlow. You'll see how to build your own image classifier in TensorFlow.\n\n### Unsupervised Learning\n\nIn this section, we'll be going over the main **unsupervised learning algorithms**, including several clustering methods, and dimensionality reduction. Unsupervised learning is all about finding groupings in data without specific metrics, like accuracy, to aim for; it is also used heavily in reducing the dimensionality of data. You'll go through several mini-projects and labs in which you'll be able to apply these concepts with real data.",

Specifically, you can find the following courses:\n\n* **Prerequisite: Python for Data Analysis**\n* **Prerequisite: SQL**\n* **Prerequisite: Command Line Essentials**\n* **Prerequisite: Git & Github**\n\n> Please use these courses to refresh your knowledge on any of these areas as you feel is necessary!  The courses in the regular classroom are intended to prepare you for the projects, but a little refresher never hurts.  \n\n---\n\n## Additional Material\n\nWe've also included additional material with specific areas of focus that are not required for this program, but may include skills that pique your curiosity or help distinguish you from other machine learning specialists (if you plan to pursue a new career). If you'd like to do a deeper dive into these math and programming concepts, we've included the following additional sections for exploration:\n\n* **Additional Material: Data Visualization**\n* **Additional Material: Practical Statistics**\n* **Additional Material: Linear Algebra**\n",
