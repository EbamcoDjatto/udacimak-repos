You'll learn how to optimize your code, write tests and documentation for a code base, and build a Python package of your own. These skills are valuable in any engineering job and will act as a great foundation for applying machine learning skills in industry.\n\n### Machine Learning in Production\n\nIn this section, you'll learn about cloud services and model deployment. Deployment means making a model available for use in a piece of hardware or web application, such as a voice assistant or recommendation engine. In this lesson, you'll see how to analyze housing data and deploy a predictive model in SageMaker. In addition to learning about model deployment, you’ll also learn about model serving and updating. You'll learn how to connect a deployed model to a website through an API using AWS services. After deploying the model, you’ll update the model to account for changes in the underlying text data—an especially valuable skill in industries that continuously collect data. By the end of this section, you should have all the skills you need to train and deploy models to solve tasks of your own design!\n\n### Machine Learning, Deployment Case Studies\n\nIn partnership with AWS, we’ve created a course that examines a variety of machine learning models as they are applied, at-scale, to real-world tasks. You’ll learn how to deploy both unsupervised and supervised algorithms and apply them to tasks such as feature engineering and time series forecasting. This content addresses questions such as: \n1. How do you decide on the correct machine learning model for a given task?\n2. How can you utilize cloud deployment tools such as AWS SageMaker to work with data and improve your machine learning models?",

Recently, machine learning has been adopted by a wide range of industries, including medical diagnostic companies, finance and market prediction firms, and many more. Udacity’s Machine Learning Nanodegree program was built in response to this demand to provide access to this growing tech field to a broader audience.\n\nWe’ve seen advances in research and industry practices as more companies look to build machine learning products. **Specifically, there is a growing demand for engineers who are able to deploy machine learning models to global audiences**.  Also, machine learning engineers are often expected to work within larger software development teams. To keep up with this advancement and bring the best educational experience to our students, we have included content that includes:\n* Best practices for software engineering, and \n* The latest deployment skills, including deploying models at scale and updating models in response to changes in the underlying data.\n\nThese skills will set you apart from engineers who know only machine learning algorithms, but not the details of machine learning product development, at scale. So, I hope you're excited to learn even more!\n\n",
