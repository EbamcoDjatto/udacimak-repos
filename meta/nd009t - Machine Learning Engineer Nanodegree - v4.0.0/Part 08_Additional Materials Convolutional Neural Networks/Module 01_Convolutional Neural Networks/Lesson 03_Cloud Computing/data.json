Free credits are not available to Udacity Enterprise students, students in subscription Nanodegree programs, or NLP Nanodegree program students. Learners who do not qualify for free credits should complete all project through the associated Workspaces in the classroom.\n\n#### Please skip this section if you are planning to use your own GPU or CPU, or if your Nanodegree program does not qualify for the AWS Educate credits or if you are **not** planning to use Amazon EC2.\n\nTraining and evaluating deep neural networks is a computationally intensive task. For modestly sized problems and datasets it may be possible to train your network on the CPU in your local machine, but it could take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours depending on the number of epochs, the size of the neural networks, and other factors. A faster alternative is to train on a [GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit), which is a type of processor that supports greater parallelism.\n\nIf you do not already have a computer with a built-in NVIDIA GPU, we suggest you use an [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance. There are many cloud service providers that offer equivalent functionality, but EC2 is a reasonable default that is available to most students. In the next few sections, we'll go over the steps from nothing to running a neural network on an Amazon server.",

On your instance terminal, there will be the following line:\n`Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time, to login with a token:`.  Copy everything starting with the `:8888/?token=`.\n* Access the Jupyter notebook index from your web browser by visiting: `X.X.X.X:8888/?token=...` (where X.X.X.X is the IP address of your EC2 instance and everything starting with `:8888/?token=` is what you just copied).\n* Click on a folder, like \"mnist\", to enter it and select a notebook, such as the \"mnist_mlp.ipynb\" notebook.\n* Run each cell in the notebook.\n\nFor some notebooks, you should see a marked decrease in training time when compared to running the same cells using a typical CPU!\n\n**NOTE:** Windows users may prefer connecting via the GUI utility PuTTY, by following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console).\n\n---\n##### Important: Cost\n\n**From this point on, AWS will charge you for a running an EC2 instance. ** You can find the details on the [EC2 On-Demand Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/).\n\nMost importantly, remember to `stop` (i.e. shutdown) your instances when you are not using them. Otherwise, your instances might run for a day or a week or a month without you remembering, and you’ll wind up with a large bill!\n\nAWS charges primarily for running instances, so most of the charges will cease once you stop the instance. However, there are smaller storage charges that continue to accrue until you “terminate” (i.e. delete) the instance.",
